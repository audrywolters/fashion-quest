## Description
Fashion Quest is a vintage style, tongue-in-cheek, text based adventure game.

I love clothes, dresses, necklaces, etc. I find if I am comfortable and look sharp - I feel pretty good.
Unfortunately, many people are intimidated by fashion. Things like beauty, weight, gender, and trendiness are big turn-offs - they scare people away.

So I created a game that removes all those things. Because it is all text w/ no photos, there are no impossibly gorgeous models, no gender biases, no trendiness. 

Anyone can play Fashion Quest because the rules of dressing are the same across the board! Wear clothes that fit your unique body and express your unique style.

## I Learned
Building this was a 2 week adventure in itself! 

I struggled with basic input and output! I developed some imposter syndrome until I asked my instructor for help. She said I was trying to build a 1980s C++ game in React - which is not made for this sort of thing! :D
I am proud of my (unintentionally) anti-establishment, avant guard, :P, exploration into React.
I even though I molded React into a form of my own, I gained a deeper knowledge of the language.

While it was very hard work, it was still a joy.

## Next Steps
I have big dreams for this application. I would like to add Dungeons and Dragons style statistics such as FP (fashion points), CP (confidence points), random encounter battles, and a very big piece:

How to put an outfit together. I learned many things from TV's "What Not to Wear" and "Queer Eye".
The player would lose FP if *everything* they were wearing was tight or shiny, etc.

I would also like to publish this online for anyone to play. Keep an eye out!
